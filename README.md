# Industrial-Copper-Modeling


## Objective

> The industrial copper market is dynamic and subject to various factors that influence its selling price. Accurately predicting the selling price of copper is crucial for manufacturers, traders, and stakeholders to make informed business decisions and plan their operations effectively. Additionally, categorizing the status of copper transactions helps in monitoring and streamlining the transaction lifecycle.

 > The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning solution that predicts the selling price of copper based on historical transaction data and classifies the status of each transaction. By leveraging features such as item date, quantity (in tons), customer information, country, item type, application, dimensions (thickness, width), and material/product references, the model aims to provide reliable price predictions and status classifications.
